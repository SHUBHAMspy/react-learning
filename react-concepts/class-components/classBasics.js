//*A "class" in Javascript is a bluprint for creating objects that have the same properties & access to the same methods.
/* - They are basically "Syntactic Sugar" on top of setting up prototype chains manually. 
- They contain properties also called fields. Properties or fields can be data or methods.
- Objects can be initialized in two ways:
  1. Using "Class Fields" to set properties with values that will be same for every object i.e static fields or properties.
  2. Using "contructor()" method can be used to set dynamic properties of object. */
